<h1>Roman Rakhman</h1>
<p>Senior Fullstack Engineer | JavaScript & TypeScript Expert | 20+ Years of Experience</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Senior Fullstack Engineer with over 20 years of experience, with a primary focus on modern Frontend development and
   high-performance UI architecture. Expert in building scalable web ecosystems using React 19 and Vue 3, I specialize
   in creating seamless user experiences by bridging the gap between sophisticated backend infrastructures and intuitive
   interfaces.</p>
<p>My expertise includes architecting unified API strategies with GraphQL (Apollo Federation), orchestrating
   mission-critical workflows with Temporal.io, and implementing robust state management patterns using TanStack Query.
   I have a deep background in multi-tenant architecture and e-commerce systems, with a proven track record of
   modernizing legacy platforms, and leading technical evolutions that deliver immediate business value.</p>

<h2>Technical Expertise</h2>
<p>Frontend: JavaScript (ESNext), TypeScript, Vue 3 (Composition API), React 19, Next.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, PWA, Web
   Accessibility (A11y).</p>
<p>State Management: GraphQL (Apollo Federation), TanStack Query, Pinia.</p>
<p>Backend: Node.js, NestJS, Express.js, RESTful APIs, Serverless (AWS Lambda / GCP Functions), Puppeteer (Automation),
   WebSockets.</p>
<p>Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Prisma ORM.</p>
<p>Testing & Quality: Jest, Vitest, Cypress, Playwright, ESLint/Prettier, CI/CD (GitHub Actions).</p>
<p>Cloud & DevOps: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS, Docker, Kubernetes (K8s), Kafka, Monitoring (Prometheus,
   Grafana).</p>
<p>Workflow & Architecture: Temporal.io (Workflow Orchestration), System Design, Microservices, Agile/Scrum.</p>

<h2>Key Achievements</h2>
<p>Microservices Orchestration & Architecture: Designed and implemented a unified API Gateway using Apollo Federation,
   successfully consolidating 25+ microservices into a scalable Supergraph for a major fundraising platform.</p>
<p>Next-Gen Frontend Architecture: Spearheaded the transition of complex internal systems to a high-performance stack
   (React 19, Vue 3, Tailwind CSS), implementing advanced data-fetching patterns with TanStack Query to enhance UI
   responsiveness and developer velocity.</p>
<p>Enterprise White Label Solutions: Architected and launched a global dating engine supporting thousands of concurrent
   domains and millions of users; improved mobile conversion rates by implementing PWA and optimizing frontend
   performance.</p>
<p>Scalable High-Load Systems: Built a real-time ads-on-demand platform from the ground up using Node.js and OpenRTB
   protocol, implementing a robust monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana) that ensured 99.9% uptime during peak
   traffic.</p>
